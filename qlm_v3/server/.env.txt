# The following `prisma+postgres` URL is similar to the URL produced by running a local Prisma Postgres 
# server with the `prisma dev` CLI command, when not choosing any non-default ports or settings. The API key, unlike the 
# one found in a remote Prisma Postgres URL, does not contain any sensitive information.

# In order to use prisma, it is better for user to use root account of the database.
